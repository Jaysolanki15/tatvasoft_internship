This is made for my internship at tatvasoft . This include my work that i have done  on daily basis .

üìù Day 1 - Introduction to PostgreSQL and Hands-on Practice
On the first day of my internship, we were introduced to PostgreSQL, an open-source, object-relational database management system. The session covered the basics of relational databases and the key features that make PostgreSQL powerful and reliable for data-driven applications. We discussed its architecture, use cases, and how it differs from other SQL databases like MySQL.
After the theoretical overview, we got hands-on experience by setting up a PostgreSQL environment, creating our first databases, and writing simple SQL queries. This practical session helped reinforce our understanding and gave us a strong foundation to build upon in the upcoming days.


üìù Day 2 ‚Äì Learning Angular & Building a Resume Generator
On Day 2 of my internship, I started learning Angular, a popular framework used to build dynamic websites and applications. I learned the basics like:

What components and modules are

How Angular uses templates

How to show data and respond to user input

To put this into practice, I built a Resume Builder project using Angular. It lets users fill in their personal and career details, and then it automatically creates a resume using a fixed, professional layout.

This mini-project helped me understand how Angular works in real-world scenarios‚Äîespecially things like forms, data binding, and displaying information in a clean format. It was a fun and valuable learning experience!
